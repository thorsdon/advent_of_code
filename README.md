Learning to code with Python, ChatGPT and Avent of Code

I have coded as a kid in Basic and some coding classes in university, but now working as a product manager so mostly experienced in providing the epics and stories of what to code for development teams. With ChatGPT out there it seemed a good spent of my time to pickup coding again with the following objectives:

1) Adding coding as a skill for personal projects
2) Learn how LLM's can provide an accelerated learning path in general
3) What the right balance is between syntax, function knowledge and LLM input on these area's

This repository will contain code to solve Advent of Code puzzles and markups with learnings, ChatGPT code reviews and suggestions in Jupyter notebooks.
