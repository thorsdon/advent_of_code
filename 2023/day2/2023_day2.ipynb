    "This code reads a file and calculates the sum of the IDs of \"games\" that meet specific criteria based on the number of colored items (\"red,\" \"green,\" \"blue\"). Each line in the file represents a game, and the code checks if any game is \"impossible\" based on predefined maximum values for each color. If a game is not impossible, its ID (which is its line number starting from 1) is added to a cumulative sum. Here's the explanation for each part of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   sum_possible = 0\n",
    "   max_values = {'red': 12, 'green': 13, 'blue': 14}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - `sum_possible` is initialized to 0. This variable will hold the cumulative sum of the IDs of all possible games.\n",
    "   - `max_values` is a dictionary holding the maximum allowed number of items for each color.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Opening and Reading the File**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open('2023_day2_input_example.txt', 'r') as f:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This opens the file `'2023_day2_input_example.txt'` in read mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iterating Over Each Line**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for i, line in enumerate(f.readlines()):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The file is read line by line. `enumerate(f.readlines())` provides a tuple of the line number (starting from 0) and the line content.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Processing Each Line**:\n",
    "   - `impossible = False`: Initially, each game is assumed to be possible.\n",
    "   - `picks = line.strip()[line.find(':')+2:].split('; ')`: This line processes the current line to extract the relevant data. It removes leading/trailing whitespace (`strip()`), finds the part of the line after the colon (`:`) which represents the game data, and splits this data into parts at each semicolon (`;`).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Checking Each Part for Impossibility**:\n",
    "   - The nested loops (`for p in picks:` and `for part in p.split(', '):`) iterate over each part of the game data.\n",
    "   - `num, colour = part.split(' ')`: Each part (e.g., \"3 red\") is split into a number (`num`) and a color (`colour`).\n",
    "   - `num = int(num)`: Converts the number from string to integer.\n",
    "   - `if num > max_values[colour]:`: Checks if the number for any color exceeds the maximum allowed value. If it does, the game is marked as impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Summing Up the IDs of Possible Games**:\n",
    "   - `if not impossible: sum_possible += i+1`: If the game is possible (not impossible), its ID (which is `i+1` because `enumerate` starts from 0, but game IDs start from 1) is added to `sum_possible`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Printing the Result**:\n",
    "   - `print(sum_possible)`: Finally, the cumulative sum of the IDs of all possible games is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code essentially filters out games that exceed the maximum number of items for any color and sums up the IDs of the remaining (possible) games."

    "Yes, you can make the code more efficient and concise by using a dictionary to track the maximum number of each color. This approach eliminates the need for multiple `if-elif` conditions and makes it easier to extend the code if more colors are added later. Here's how you can do it:\n",

    "Understanding nested loops can indeed be challenging, especially when dealing with multiple layers of them. Let's break down your loop structure to clarify what's happening at each level and where the `multiplied` calculation fits in. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Loop Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Outermost Loop - Reading Each Line in the File**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open('2023_day2_input.txt', 'r') as f:\n",
    "       for i, line in enumerate(f.readlines()):\n",
    "           # ... inner loops ...\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This loop reads each line of the file. `i` is the line number (starting from 0), and `line` is the content of the current line.\n",
    "   - Each `line` represents a separate game or a set of data to process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Middle Loop - Processing Each Pick in a Line**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   picks = line.strip()[line.find(':')+2:].split('; ')\n",
    "   for p in picks:\n",
    "       # ... innermost loop ...\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Here, each `line` is split into parts, separated by `'; '`. Each part (`p`) represents a different segment within the line.\n",
    "   - This loop processes each segment of a line.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Innermost Loop - Processing Each Part of a Pick**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for part in p.split(', '):\n",
    "       num, colour = part.split(' ')\n",
    "       num = int(num)\n",
    "       # ... code to update max_values ...\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Each segment (`p`) is further split into smaller parts, separated by `', '`. Each `part` contains a number and a color.\n",
    "   - This loop processes each of these smaller parts, updating `max_values` accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applying the `multiplied` Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `multiplied` calculation should be applied after all the inner loops have finished processing a single line. This means it should be indented at the same level as the middle loop but outside of it:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  with open('2023_day2_input.txt', 'r') as f:\n",
    "      for i, line in enumerate(f.readlines()):\n",
    "          # ... code to process each line ...\n",
    "\n",
    "          # Calculate the multiplied value after processing all picks in the line\n",
    "          multiplied = max_values['red'] * max_values['green'] * max_values['blue']\n",
    "          sum_multiplied += multiplied\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- By placing the calculation at this level, you ensure that `multiplied` is calculated once per line, after all the data in that line has been processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips for Keeping Track of Loop Levels\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Consistent Indentation**: Python uses indentation to define blocks of code. Ensure each level of indentation is consistent to visually separate different loop levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Comments**: Use comments to mark the beginning and end of loops, especially if they are complex or deeply nested.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Refactoring**: If loops get too complicated, consider refactoring parts of the code into separate functions. This can make the code more readable and easier to manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Debugging Prints**: Temporarily add `print` statements inside loops to show where you are in the loop and what values variables have.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these practices, you can make your nested loop structures clearer and easier to understand."
